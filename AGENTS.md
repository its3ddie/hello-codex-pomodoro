# AGENTS.md
**Project Type:** Static site (HTML/CSS/JS), no build step.

**Conventions:**
- Keep code beginner-friendly with comments.
- Avoid adding frameworks unless explicitly asked.
- When refactoring, split into `styles.css` and `script.js` and update `index.html` accordingly.

**Testing/Checks:**
- Open `index.html` and verify:
  - Timer starts, pauses, and resets correctly.
  - Auto-switch between Focus and Break phases.
  - Beep plays at phase change.

**Definition of Done (for small tasks):**
- Implement changes cleanly.
- Test locally (no build required).
- Update README with any new features.
