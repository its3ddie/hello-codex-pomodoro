A beginner-friendly Pomodoro timer built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, perfect for learning and experimenting with OpenAI Codex.

## Features
- Separate `styles.css` and `script.js` files for clarity.
- Toggle between dark and light themes.
- Short beep sound when switching between Focus and Break phases.
- Editing Focus/Break minutes while idle updates the countdown immediately.

## How to Run
- Download the repo or clone it.
- Open `index.html` in your browser — no setup required.

## Goals
- Keep it simple (no build tools).
- Make changes easy for Codex to implement.
- Help beginners learn by reading and running the code.

## Ideas for Codex Tasks
- Add presets for different focus/break times.

## How to Run Tests
- Open `tests/test.html` in your browser. The Mocha suite runs automatically.
- All tests should be green within a couple seconds.
- Refresh the page to run the tests again, or point a headless browser at the file for automated checks.
